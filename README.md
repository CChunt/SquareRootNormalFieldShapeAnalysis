# SquareRootNormalFieldShapeAnalysis

This repository contains an end-to-end toolkit for performing function principal component analysis (fPCA) on three dimensional meshes. It's focus pertains to meshes derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain structures, but may be extended to any set of objects.

```math
L^2 = \int_{S^2} ||q_1 - R\gamma(q_2)\sqrt{J_\gamma}||^2 d\Omega
```
